### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Rawle, a full-stack developer with a love for learning, cooking, and music! I graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 2014 with a degree in Criminal Justice & Criminology, and am currently a Music Programming Director at SiriusXM Satellite Radio! Some of my hobbies include cooking everything from wings to beef wellington, playing, making, and listening to music, and watching a good comedy series or movie. I'm constantly striving to hone my software developer skills through new frameworks and techniques, to meet the ever-changing challenges of today's tech world!
